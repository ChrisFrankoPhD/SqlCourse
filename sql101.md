# SQL 101 - Databases for Beginners

- okay so SQL is the a programming language, "structured Query Language", that is designed for managing data help in a relational database management system
- then we want to work with relational database management systems like MariaDB, Postgres (aka PostgraSQL)
- SQLite seems to also be the same as Postgres, but Postgres is a bit more feature rich and powerful

## What is a Schema

- in a schema, we have columns, rows, and tables
- in excel for example, a table is a sheet, we have many sheets and they all have some number of columns and rows, which allows us to store data in cells
- in the table, we can have a column for ID, UserName, Profession, Password, whatever
- we can then have our rows fill in data  in each of these columns, and the data is linked by the row, meaning each row represents one object, or one person in this case
- and this whole thing, the columns, rows, and tables (sheets), is called a schema
- a schema is not an entire database, it is a little mini database inside of the bigger database like sql, where we can set up the database with some data that we want to store
- and in the schema we can build multiple tables as we know from excel, the second sheet might be 'courses' in this exampel for the instructors little teaching database
- so from now we will be working with SQL in a service called SQLite online, and we will need to be able to work with schemas, and be able to select data and stuff

## Browser-based Database

- we are going to be working on sqliteonline.com, which is a browser version of sqlite
- we see here we can use different management systems, and we will go with Postgres since it is more powerful apparently, but the commands we are going to use are universal to SQL systems, so we can use other ones as needed, we just need to learn the features
- we see if we click on PostgresQL on the side bar, and hit click to connect, there is a demo Table availible that we can open, and we see on the display there is some data in 3 columns, ID, Name, and Hint, which gives us some names a short description
- so now we want to be able to use teh SQL language to work with this data

## Selecting Data

- in SQL data, we select data ver intuitively with `SELECT column_name, column_name2 FROM demo;`, and this will show us the corresponding data in columns 'column_name' and 'column_name2' from the table 'demo' 
- so for example i can run `SELECT name, hint FROM demo;`, and we see the program automatically fully capitalizes 'NAME' and 'HINT' for us, and now in the display, data from the name and hint columns are shown
    - note, this looks liek different data than I was just looking at in demo though?
    - okay it looks liek the data it was showing was from the SQLite demo data, which has an automatic `SELECT * from demo` command run when we load the page since SQLite is the default
- we could also choose all columns by replacing column names with *, which we have seen in languages before

## Ordering Data

- we can also reorder data, for example if we wanted to order the data alphabetically based on the hint column, we could do `SELECT * from demo ORDER BY hint DESC`, and now we see teh data is organized in decending alphbetical order, so from z-a, based on the first character of the hint column, and of course we could do ascending as well with `ASC`

## Selecting Specific Data

- we can then select spefic data rows from our query with the `WERE` keyword, for example: `SELECT * from demo WHERE id=3` and we see just the row with id of 3 gets return
- now this is like a programming language in the sense that we did not need to put `3` in a string, since the ID values are int, but if we want to get a specifc row based on the name column, we would do `SELECT * from demo WHERE name='test'`, and if we dont make `'test'` a string, then we get an error saying column test doesnt exist
- we can also this with any column, where we could imagine a situation where we get all customer data from a specifc country for example

## Selecting a Range of Data

- we can also select rangs of data by using operators like the `>`: `SELECT * from demo WHERE id>3;`, we can also use `OR` operators to do things like: `SELECT * from demo WHERE id>3 or name='test';` and we see we get back results that fit both conditions 
- we see we can cahin these together with the `ORDER` command we learned as well, `SELECT * from demo WHERE id>3 or name='test' ORDER by hint desc;`, so now we get the filtered data also ordered by hint descending

## Ordering Selected Data

- so this is going over what i just mentioned before, where we can select data, then order it by chaining commands like `SELECT * from demo WHERE id>3 or name='test' ORDER by hint desc;`

## Limiting Data

- right now our test data is like 6 rows, but maybe we have 100k rows, and we dont want to access or even store that much data
- we can limit the amount of data that gets returned using the `LIMIT` command, which again can be chained with other commands
- for example in the about query, we returned 4 different rows, since that what matches the `OR` query, but we could also do `SELECT * from demo WHERE id>3 or name='test' ORDER by hint desc LIMIT 2;`. where the `limit 2` at the end just makes only the first 2 rows appear
- we can also just look at all the data, but limit it with `SELECT * FROM demo LIMIT 3;`, for example 
- this i actually useful for being more efficient with our searches at times, since if we have a database with usernames, and we want to find a specific username, we would do `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='chrisfranko';` and this will search every singly entry, even if it finds the username, it will check the rest to see i there are more
- instead we can do `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='chrisfranko' LIMIT 1;`, so once it finds the right username, it just stops searching since it reached the max 

## Inserting Data

- we want to be able to add data to our database of course, and we can do that with the `INSERT` command, for example `INSERT INTO demo(name, hint) values('chris', 'likes to pert ferb'), ('ferbie', 'likes to be pet by anyone'), ('sara', 'likes to travel');`
- we see that in our display, we see nothing now, it looks liek there is no data, but that is because our query did not return any data, we simply added more data
- so we can see the new data now with the standard `SELECT * from demo`, and we see that we now have all the new rows we just added in the database!
- **NOTICE THAT WE DID NOT GIVE THE VALUES AN ID NUMBER**, even though our first column is `ID`, we can set up our tables to autoincrement the ID number column for each new piece of data added, and that is the default here
- as an aside, we can also comment out in SQL by adding `--` to start of a line, this nice cause we can comment out our value addition statement and then see all the data so we know what we just added to reference
- we see we can also have multiple lines going at once for dealign with our data, which we havent used yet, for example we could do:
```
INSERT INTO demo(name, hint) values('chris', 'likes to pert ferb'), ('ferbie', 'likes to be pet by anyone'), ('sara', 'likes to travel');

SELECT * from demo
```
- and this will insert the data and return all the data all at once
- presumably we could combine this with some other language liek python of JS to insert data that we reiceve automatically so that we do not have to type out all of our data by hand
- we also see that if we run this multiple times, we duplicate the data, and we have a bunch of overlapping data, but we can deal with that in the next video

## Updating Data

- we can update specific or multiple piece of data with the `UPDATE` and `SET` commands: `UPDATE demo SET name='sara huh' where name='sara'`, and this finds all rows with name='sara', and changes the name to 'sara huh', we also see that when we do this, Postgres automatically puts all of those updated rows at the bottom of the table in the viewer, not sure why this is a functionality, I assume it is useful
    - but the ID numbers dont chnage or anything, so we can just do `select * from demo order by id asc` and it is now sorted by ID again
    - okay so if we sort by ID liek that, then go back to normal show all data with `select * from demo`, we are back again to having all the updated values at the bottom ,so i guess the default sorting method by postgres is like a 'last modified' descending or something
- we can the do soemthign like `UPDATE demo SET hint='loves subtitles' where name='sara huh';`, so that we can update the name, then update a different variable based ont hat name in a single query
- so this looks liek this is all for this video, and i guess he is not going over getting rid of duplicates like he mentioned, but maybe n the next lesson

## Delete Data

- so ya now we are going to delete the duplicate data 
- we delete data with the `DELETE` command, `delete from demo where id=12 or id=15;`, and we see when we select all again, we end up seeing our data and the rows of selected id numbers are deleted 
- we need to be careful with this though, just liek with anythign that can change or delete data, we have to be careful to not do somehting like `delete from demo;`, since it will delete everything from the demo sheet
- we can be more careful by putting our select clauses first, so we can check what we are deleting:
```
SELECT from demo where id=12 or id=15;
```
- see what this command selects, then:
```
delete from demo where id=12 or id=15;
```

## Creating a New Table

- we want to be able to make our own tables of course, and we do this with the `CREATE TABLE <TABLE_NAME> ( <COLUMN_NAME> <TYPE> <ATTRIBUTES>, <second_column_name> <TYPE> <ATTRIBUTES>, etc)`
- apparently the uppercase styling is just from this website, it does it automatically to help visualize things
- so we can create a new table for an imaginary store inventory with:
```
create table mystore(id INT, product VARCHAR(50), price DECIMAL(8,2), item_sold INT default 0, notes VARCHAR(255));
```
- we see we are specifying the column names and the data type that goes into each column
- we see `varchar(x)` specifies that it can be a variable character data type with a max length of 50, we could use `text` instead which has no limit i believe, but it is nice to make sure thigns do not overflow
- `decimal(p,s)` specifies a decimal, basically float, number that can have up to `p` significant digits, and `s` digits after the decimal place, so we specify s = 2 for money
    - alternatively we could of done `float`, but float does not take a range and as a result cam only be calculated approximately, while since the precision of teh decimal is eact, tehy are exact numbers
    - we could also use the `money` type, which is just equal to `decimal(16,2)`, and we can also specify a different precision with `money(p)`, but the fractional precision is always 2
    - `money` is often favoured by professionals when using money according to some stack exchnage post, but who knows
    - lastly, `int` is appraently the same as `integer`, justa  shortcut, and store an int, he used `integer` in the video so i wanted to use `int` for comparison
- now we can add data with the insert command, in my case i did:
```
insert into mystore(product, price, notes) values
  ('pillow', 5.99, 'soft and fluffy'), 
  ('blanket', 10.99, 'king size, made of wood, not very soft'), 
  ('mattress', 99999.99, 'made of blankets, too soft')
 ;
select * from mystore;
```
- where we specify the column we are entering data for in the `mystore()` paranthesis
- however we see that `ID` was not automatically defined and iterated for us, whereas in the video it was for him, and i dont think i did anything different besides use `int` instead of `integer`
    - i ran the same thing with `integer` and still all my IDs are `NULL`, so maybe a change in the site or language since the video was recorded
    - okay so in order to fix this, we can remove the column using `ALTER TABLE mystore DROP column ID;`, then we can re-add a new ID column with the `serial` data type, and we can also (maybe optionally?) set it with a `PRIMARY KEY` constraint that makes the ID a unique identifier for each row in the table, 
    - so we do `Alter Table mystore add column id serial PRIMARY KEY;`, and now when we examine our data, we have a new ID column (after we removed the faled one), and it is auto-filled with sequential integers, however we do notice it is at the END of the table, and this is unchangable in postgresql, however we could create a new tabel "view", which we wont get into, that can have it first, but in the actual data it will still be last
        - NOTE, the `primary key` constaraint adds the additional constriant that it they must be unique and cannot be Null (note, we can also only have one primary key, **BUT** that primary key can be multipel columns, like Primary KEY (ID, Letter) or something, so 1A, 1B, are each unique even though ID is the same since letter differs)
        - IMO it make sense to assing the ID as a primary key
- we can also make a new table as example for making the ID auto fill from the start, we can do:
```
create table mystore4(
  id serial, 
  product VARCHAR(50), 
  price DECIMAL(8,2), 
  item_sold INT default 0, 
  notes VARCHAR(255),
  PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
insert into mystore4(product, price, notes) values
  ('pillow', 5.99, 'soft and fluffy'), 
  ('blanket', 10.99, 'king size, made of wood, not very soft'), 
  ('mattress', 99999.99, 'made of blankets, too soft')
;

select * from mystore4;
```
- where create table is jsut formatted here more like JS for readability, and we get the same result from the outset here
- apparently ususally with SQL we are not creating tables, but instead are just working with and adding/getting data

## Truncating Data

- teh `TRUNCATE` message is used to delete all rows from  a table quickly, the columns, the table, and schema will still exist, bit of we do 
```
TRUNCATE mystore2;
select * FROM mystore2;
```
- we see all the data is gone, and it looks liek there are no columns, but we see on the sidebar the columns still exist, but since there is no rows it doesnt show the column headers

## Deleting a Table

- we completely delete a table and all data quickly with `DROP TABLE mystore;`, and we need to be careful with this again since it is gone, but this is useful since we will often create temporary tables when building a main one, and we dont want to keep these around forever 

## Final Project

- create a new table
- insert 5 products
- select exactly 3 out of the 5
- take a screenshot, share it with the calss
- my final project queries:

```
--CREATE TABLE courses(
--  id serial,
--  course_name VARCHAR(30),
--  hours dec(3,1),
--  is_completed BOOLEAN default False,
--  PRIMARY KEY (ID)
--  );

--INSERT INTO courses(course_name, hours, is_completed) VALUES
--   ('html201', 1.3, True),
--   ('css301', 0.5, True),
--  ('javascript201', 2.0, True),
--   ('python301', 1.9, True),
--   ('django101', 2.1, False);

--select * from courses
select * from courses where course_name LIKE '%201%'
```

- one thing i learned in the final project, is that we can search for rows with entires of a column containing a string with `select * from courses where course_name LIKE '%201%'`, where we are searching the `course_name` column for entires that have a substring match with '201', the `%` notation means we are including substring matches, if we want a direct match we would just do `'201'` instead
